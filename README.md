# Logistic-Regression-Project
Predict the heart attack for the organisation WHO (World Health Organisation), using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack will increase or decrease.
## **Problem Statement** : 
## The World Health Organisation estimated 17 million death records. Half of the death result is found ny us. The research scholars point out the most relavent risk factor of heart attack as a data science engineer predict the overall risk using machine learning algorithm logistic regression
## **Task 1** : Import the libraries which is required for prediction.
## **Task 2** : Import the dataset in your workspace.
## **Task 3** : Use an appriopriate argument of sklearn library to train, test and split the datasets.

## **Task 4** : Fit your values with arange() using feature scaling.
## **Task 5** : Check your model's accuracy and precision using confusion matrix.
